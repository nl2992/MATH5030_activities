        "\n",
        "2) **Bracketed Newton, using bisection**\n",
        "**Problem:** Plain Newton can sometimes take a step that is too large (or heads toward the boundary `r -> -1`), which can cause slow convergence or divergence. This is especially risky because `(1+r)` must remain positive when `tk` is non-integer. A new update rule was created that is bounded using the `(lo + high)/2`, which is effectively akin to a `binary search`.\n",

        "3) **Better starting values for SciPy secant (multiple `(x0, x1)` attempts)**\n",
        "**Problem:** Secant/Newton-family methods are sensitive to initial guesses. A poor choice of `(x0, x1)` can increase iterations or cause failure. We use several potential \"scale- aware\" pairs and tries the first one that converges.\n",
